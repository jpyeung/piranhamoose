Skii is a user interface designed to help people going on ski trips to better coordinate such trips. Users will be able to display the details about a trip, such as choosing a resort, details about departure, and the list of people going on the trip, etc.

Skii has been developed for the MIT class 6.813 (User Interfaces), by James Yeung, Adam Yedidia, and Stacey Terman.
